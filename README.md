# Logistic Regression from Scratch
Multiple implementations of Logistic Regression for classification tasks using out of the box methods from sklearn and hand coded from scratch.

### Installation
Requires python3 and the standard anaconda distribution.
Otherwise you will need the following imports:

- math
- csv
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot

### Motivation
To get a better grasp of logistic regression through coding the algorithm from scratch.

### File Descriptions
2 csv files hold the training and test data sets. Note
the test data does not have the actual targets as this is
Kaggle competition data so answers are to be submitted
blind. 1 jupyter notebook shows the work with commentary and relevant
results.

### Results
Achieved similar results to Sklearn's implementation of
Logistic Regression for classification through scratch code.
We could take this a step further and import the file without the csv import and hand code functions for the 
exponential function and natural log function so we need 0 imports to run this.

Implementation is used from Andrew Ng's Coursera course in
deep learning.
